- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nickssilver
I'm a multi-talented human. Most of my time I code and design .
I donâ€™t like to define myself by the work Iâ€™ve done. 
I define myself by the work I want to do. 
Skills can be taught, personality is inherent. 
I prefer to keep learning, continue challenging myself, and do interesting things that matter.
Fueled by high energy levels and boundless enthusiasm, Iâ€™m easily inspired and more then willing to follow my fascinations wherever they take me.
Iâ€™m passionate, expressive spirit with a natural ability to entertain and inspire. Iâ€™m never satisfied to just come up with ideas.
Instead I have an almost impulsive need to act on them.
